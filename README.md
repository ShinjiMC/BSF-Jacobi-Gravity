# BSF-Jacobi
Parallel implementation of Jacobi method using the higher-order functions Map and Reduce

This repository contains source codes of a parallel implementation of the iterative Jacobi method for solving systems of linear algebraic equations on computing clusters. The solution is built using the BSF-skeleton in C++. The source codes of the BSF skeleton with the user guide are available at https://github.com/leonid-sokolinsky/BSF-skeleton.

A description of the apex-method is available in the paper https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.14921.
